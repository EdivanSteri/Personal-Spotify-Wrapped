# Description, what it does and expedients
Simple web application where you can view data from Spotify.
The top three artists you listen to the most and for each one you can view his song you listen to the most, his most popular song and his released album.

First you will have to have a Spotify account because you will have to log into it if you want to test it. 
Second thing you will have to create a developer dashbord with your spotify account.

I created the backend, then the data processing and the Spotify api callback with .NET6(C#). Also in my account you will find the repository to it.
You will need to have it locally and start it for everything to work.
Within the repository inherent to the backend it will be explained how to set up the backend locally.
Within this project in the .env file, which you will need to add to the root of the project, you will need to set the value of the environment variables that indicated the backend url:
REACT_APP_BACKEND_BASE_PATH=url_of_your_backend

I hope you like it.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
